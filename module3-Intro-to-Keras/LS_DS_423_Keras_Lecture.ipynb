    "The objective of the last two days has been to familiarize you with the fundamentals of neural networks: terminology, structure of networks, forward propagation, error/cost functions, backpropagation, epochs, and gradient descent. We have tried to reinforce these topics by requiring to you code some of the simplest neural networks by hand including Perceptrons (single node neural networks) and Multi-Layer Perceptrons also known as Feed-Forward Neural Networks. Continuing to do things by hand would not be the best use of our limited time. You're ready to graduate from doing things by hand and start using some powerful libraries to build cutting-edge predictive models. "

Linear functions are typically only used for very simple tasks where interpretability is important, but if interpretability is your highest priority, you probably shouldn't be using neural networks in the first place."

It has basically the same properties as the sigmoid, still struggles from diminishingly flat gradients as we move away from 0, but its derivative is higher around 0 causing weights to move to the extremes a little faster.

It doesn't activate neurons that are being passed a negative signal and passes on positive signals. Think about why this might be useful. Remember how a lot of our initial weights got set to negative numbers by chance? This would have dealt with those negative weights a lot faster than the sigmoid function updating. What does the derivative of this function look like? It looks like the step function! This means that not all neurons are activated. With sigmoid basically all of our neurons are passing some amount of signal even if it's small making it hard for the network to differentiate important and less important connections. ReLU turns off a portion of our less important neurons which decreases computational load, but also helps the network learn what the most important connections are faster. \n",

    "What's the problem with relu? Well the left half of its derivative function shows that for neurons that are initialized with weights that cause them to have no activation, our gradient will not update those neuron's weights, this can lead to dead neurons that never fire and whose weights never get updated. We would probably want to update the weights of neurons that didn't fire even if it's just by a little bit in case we got unlucky with our initial weights and want to give those neurons a chance of turning back on in the future."
